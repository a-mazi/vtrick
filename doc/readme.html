<p>
<i>vtrick</i> is a program to trick behavior of V* central heating kettles.
</p>
<h2>
Purpose
</h2>
<p>
V* kettles show sometimes a specific misbehavior.
The kettle while starting its burner in central heating mode switches it off after couple of seconds.
Burner starts are repeated several times with period of seconds with the same effect.
This leads to an excessive burner and fuel usage.
This is observed when the system reaches near-target temperature.
The kettle then detects heat consumption is too slow by slow declining return water temperature.
This is most likely interpreted as chocked circuit and the burner gets switched off to avoid damage.
</p>
<p>
To circumvent this misbehavior it is enough to set the system target temperature to some high value for a couple of seconds.
This is what <i>vtrick</i> is doing, when it detects burner start in central heating mode.
</p>
<p>
The computer is communicating with the kettle via Optolink Interface.
Device example can be seen

here
</a>
.
</p>
<h2>
Usage
</h2>
<p>
<i>vtrick</i> is started with an argument indicating Optolink Interface serial port.
</p>
<pre>
$ ./vtrick /dev/ttyUSB0
</pre>
<h2>
Build dependencies
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>
make
</p>
<li>
<p>
gtest v1.10.0 - for unit tests
</p>
<li>
<p>
lcov - for unit test coverage report
</p>
</ul>
<h2>
Known issues
</h2>
<p>
Initialization of the serial port is not always working properly.
This will be solved with coming commits.
In the meantime the serial port can be bootstrapped with the below credited software.
</p>
<h2>
Credits
</h2>
<p>
Credit goes to Peter Schulze, author of the <i>v-control - 1.2.5</i> software.
I used it in debug mode to check parameter codes my kettle is using.
If you want to add support for new kettles, it’d advise to use Peter’s program.
